# QuickBite Express Recovery Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview

**QuickBite Express**, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup, connects hungry customers to a vibrant network of restaurants and cloud kitchens. In June 2025, QuickBite faced a *major crisis*—viral food safety incidents and a delivery outage during monsoon season led to mass customer churn, falling trust, partner migration, and competitive pressure. This dashboard was designed to empower QuickBite’s leadership with clear, data-driven recovery insights for decision-making.

## 📝 Problem Statement

The June 2025 crisis caused:
- Sharp decline in active users and daily order volume
- Significant drop in customer satisfaction scores
- Migration of partner restaurants to competitors
- Rising customer acquisition costs

QuickBite launched a major recovery budget, improved food safety protocols, and upgraded the delivery network. The leadership now requires actionable insights to:
- Understand customer behavior changes
- Identify high-value customer segments for recovery
- Diagnose order and delivery trends
- Rebuild trust and loyalty with smart campaigns
- Optimize restaurant partnerships for retention
- Leverage real-time reviews and sentiment
