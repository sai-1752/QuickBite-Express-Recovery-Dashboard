# QuickBite Express Recovery Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview

**QuickBite Express**, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup, connects hungry customers to a vibrant network of restaurants and cloud kitchens. In June 2025, QuickBite faced a *major crisis*‚Äîviral food safety incidents and a delivery outage during monsoon season led to mass customer churn, falling trust, partner migration, and competitive pressure. This dashboard was designed to empower QuickBite‚Äôs leadership with clear, data-driven recovery insights for decision-making.

## üìù Problem Statement

The June 2025 crisis caused:
- Sharp decline in active users and daily order volume
- Significant drop in customer satisfaction scores
- Migration of partner restaurants to competitors
- Rising customer acquisition costs

QuickBite launched a major recovery budget, improved food safety protocols, and upgraded the delivery network. The leadership now requires actionable insights to:
- Understand customer behavior changes
- Identify high-value customer segments for recovery
- Diagnose order and delivery trends
- Rebuild trust and loyalty with smart campaigns
- Optimize restaurant partnerships for retention
- Leverage real-time reviews and sentiment

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Classify and visualize recoverable vs. at-risk customer profiles.

2. **Order Pattern Analysis**
   - Compare pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery order volumes.
   - Detect behavioral trends and sudden shifts in ordering frequency.

3. **Delivery Performance Audit**
   - Measure delivery SLAs (average time, on-time rates).
   - Highlight operational bottlenecks and improvement zones.

4. **Campaign & Loyalty Opportunities**
   - Recommend targeted engagement strategies based on demographic and behavioral analysis.
   - Quantify which campaign channels (organic, referral, paid, social) drove recovery.

5. **Restaurant Partnership Evaluation**
   - Identify top-performing and vulnerable partner restaurants.
   - Use KPI-driven forecasting for long-term partnership planning.

6. **Sentiment & Ratings Feedback**
   - Monitor negative review themes, sentiment scores, and ratings through visuals.
   - Enable timely interventions for quality improvement.

## ‚ö° Challenges Faced

- **Data Quality & Integration:** Cleaning and harmonizing large, multi-table datasets from the food delivery domain, resolving missing delivery partner IDs, correcting data inconsistencies, and handling deleted or migrated partner records.
- **Crisis Signal Detection:** Differentiating behavioral shifts due to social media incidents from normal seasonal fluctuations, accurately segmenting the business phases (pre-crisis, crisis, recovery).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Quantifying customer sentiment and review themes at scale, especially with highly negative feedback spikes following the crisis.
- **Recovery Metrics Selection:** Identifying meaningful KPIs (e.g., churn rates, recovery trends, restaurant health) that directly link to actionable business strategies, while avoiding vanity metrics.
- **Visualization Design:** Creating self-explanatory, visually intuitive dashboards usable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including clear separation of phases and color coding for acquisition channels.
- **Operational Insights:** Assessing delivery performance (average delivery time and on-time rates), handling possible outliers and operational bottlenecks embedded in the dataset.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Translating complex data findings into simple, actionable recommendations for leadership, ensuring clarity and relevance for high-level decision making.
